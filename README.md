# 📦 Order Management System

🚀 A practical Java project to simulate a basic order system using classes, object composition, and enumeration.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This application simulates a simple order system where users can register a client, define an order status, and add multiple products. It showcases the use of object-oriented programming in Java, focusing on encapsulation, composition, and enum usage to model a real-world scenario.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **OOP Concepts Applied:**
- **Encapsulation**: Attributes are private and accessed through getters/setters.
- **Object Composition**: An order contains a client and a list of products.
- **Enum Usage**: The `OrderStatus` enum defines the current state of an order.

📋 **Interactive Console Input** using `Scanner`  
📦 **Entities Modeled:**
- **Client**: name and address
- **Product**: name and price
- **Order**: contains an ID, a `Client`, a `List<Product>`, and an `OrderStatus`

📚 **Dynamic Product List** using `ArrayList<Product>`

🧮 **Total Price Calculation** based on all products in the order

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Java 17+** (compatible with Java 8+)
- **Standard Java Libraries**:
  - `Scanner` – for user input
  - `ArrayList` – for managing product lists
  - `System.out` – for displaying order details
  - `Enum` – for order status control
